      <p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><br><br>Music is an integral part of our lives. However, since the social media platforms have a huge influence on the music charts worldwide, users are exposed solely to mainstream music, therefore the recommendations on music streaming platforms are not very personalized. 
      
          <br><br>A song and emotion-based recommendation system permits the users to listen to music based on their emotions. Existing systems use audio signals using the CNN approach and collaborative filtering to recommend songs based on the user's history. The proposed research work develops a personalized system, where the user's current emotion is analyzed with the help of the chatbot. </p>
